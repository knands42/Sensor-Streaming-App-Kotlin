# Sensor Streaming App

> This belongs to a project series I created to lean and create concurrency apps that need streaming features.

I'm simulating a data streaming app that produces realtime data from any sensor hardware where this application will handle it using `Kotlin flow` and `Coroutines`.

## Up and Running
```shell
gradle run
```
